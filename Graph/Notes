Vertex:Nodes
Edges: connecting lines
graph has two traversal
    -> DFS(depth First Search) using recurssion
        -> preOrder
        -> PostOrder ()
        -> topological Sort is nothing but postOrder Traversal 
            but we can only apply with directed Acyclic graph 

    ->BFS(Breadth First Search) using Queue
        -> we need to maintain Visited set
